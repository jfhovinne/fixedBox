fixedBox is a lightweight jQuery plugin that allows you to display a fixed box in the web page.
The box is centered by default, but you can also define the left and/or top positions.

Look at a fixedBox example:

Usage:

centered:
$('div.message').fixedBox();

left = 200px, top = 100px:
$('div.message').fixedBox({x: 200, y: 100});

Note: you'll need to set the width and height of the matched nodes (e.g. in your CSS, see the styles in the provided example), in order to correctly center them.

Tested with jQuery 1.1.3.1, Firefox 1.5+, Opera 9.0+, MSIE 6.0+. Should also work with Safari 2.0+.
